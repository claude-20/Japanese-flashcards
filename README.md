# Japanese Character Flashcards

#### Video Demo: [URL HERE](https://youtu.be/rBpWYcpnjSM)

#### Description:
This Python program helps users learn Japanese characters (Hiragana or Katakana) through flashcards. The program randomly selects a character, displays its flashcard, and prompts the user to guess the pronunciation. It provides feedback on correctness and allows multiple attempts.

## Usage
1. Run the `project.py` file.
2. Choose between Hiragana and Katakana.
3. Guess the pronunciation of the displayed character.
4. Receive feedback on correctness.
5. Repeat the process for learning more characters.

## File Structure
- `project.py`: Main Python script containing the program logic.
- `hiragana.json` and `katakana.json`: JSON files containing the flashcard data.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python libraries.
- `test_project.py`: Containing Pytest tests for the program logic.
- `README.md`: This file containing project documentation.

## Dependencies
- `colorama`: Used for colorizing the output text.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `project.py` script using Python.

## Additional Notes
- The program allows for collaboration by using flashcard data from JSON files.
- Feel free to modify the flashcard data or expand the program's functionality as needed.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome!
